<h4 id="github">1. GitHub:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub is an app for depositing or storing your code online for easy access. Github also helps to keep track of your daily progress and how well you write codes or work on projects</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="awesome-screenshot">2. Awesome screenshot:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Awesome Screenshot is an app used for taking screenshots and screen recording your page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="chatgpt-and-wordtune">3.  ChatGPT and Wordtune:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For me, these two are the best combo when it comes to writing content for a webpage. ChatGPT provides ideas, while Wordtune helps modify and rewrite the content in a way that pleases and to stop using “Lorem texts” on your projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="netlify">4.  Netlify:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Netlify is an app that helps deploy your web files for free. Another exciting thing is that you can connect your GitHub repository with Netlify, so when you make changes, you don’t have to upload the file again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="twitter">5. Twitter:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people say that “Twitter is dangerous 🤔.” Well, for me, it’s not. Twitter is just like a community in which you can connect and follow up with techies like you, and you also get to learn from their posts. As a techie, you have to stay well-updated on technology changes and how they are being used. Also, you can make friends on Twitter and be aware of some tech events that you can attend and tech communities you can join.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hope you’ve learned something‼️</em></p>
